## Week report 2

### Version 1 of Dijkstra’s

Got Dijkstra’s to work but this version does not work for the wanted solution. Got help and good points from a tutoring session so will change the algorithm and data structures in the next version.

### Generated a imagehandler

The imagehandler read and generated the pixel data for vertex objects. After the tutor session it turned out there is an easier way to do this. Imagehandler will be used in the end for the GUI.

### Refactoring and lack of tests

As have to refactor the data structures and the algorithm, won't be generating any unit tests yet. Tests and javadoc will be included only next week due to this set back. 

### Next week

Next week will have version 2 of Dijkstra’s working and a MVP version of the graphical solution. Dijkstra will be using more simple vertex objects than the current solution and the vertex generation will be done during the algorithm run. The map data will be taken from a character file, instead of an image, making the data gathering/generating much easier. After this will start with proper research on JPS and start the algorithm solution.
