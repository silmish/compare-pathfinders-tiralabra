## Week report 1

### Generated the repository

Added project details to the labtool and created a repository for the project.

### Created first documents for the first deadline

Created a document folder where all the documentation will be held for the project. Added project specifications and first weekly report.


### General research of the algorithms

Made some research of both algorithms, especially JPS as not very familiar with the algorithm. Decided to use a basic priorityqueue Dijkstra’s algorithm that I have used for other assignments also.

### Initiated the project

Got the project up and running with Gradle. Got currently the base of the project already done for reading the maps and generating vertices/edges of the map data. Got a working Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented, but it does not work with the map data yet.. Not sure about the reason.

### Next week

Hopefully I will have Dijkstra's algorithm up and running on the map data so I can start focusing on JPS. Next week will hopefully have a start on the JPS algorithm, currently have no idea how to implement it yet.
