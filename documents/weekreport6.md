## Week report 6

### JPS is almost done, hopefully..

This week I unfortunately have not had much time to work on the algorithm. The time I had was used to try and get JPS to work, unfortunately without success. There seems to be some small issue now regarding the jump method that can't seem to be able to figure out. Will try to ask for help with it so could get the algorithm running and get the rest also done asap.


### Lack of tests and javadoc

As there has not been quite enough time to get the algorithm as far as I wanted, I have not had time to either create the documentation and tests for the program yet. Have decided to focus now on getting the algorithm working and after that will use time to refactor a few things and create all the tests and documentations. Not an ideal approach but I have to use the time I have on the main learning point for me, the algorithms.

### Next week

Hopefully all will be done before demo session, as still lacking a working algorithm cant be sure will be able to get everything done in time, but will get as much as can and see how far it gets me.
