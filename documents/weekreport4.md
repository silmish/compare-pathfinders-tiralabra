## Week report 4

### Started JPS

This week has been used only to study JPS. Been reading about the algorithm what even been able to find, which is not much. Managed to find the original paper written about the algorithm and it has been really helpful. Have not managed to get the actual code much further but been working on a plan how to achieve the various steps that are mentioned in the paper. Hopefully will get it more or less working next week.

### Next week

Will start implementing the code for JPS. Hopefully there will be a working version of it within next week. This means a algorithm that is able to create jump points and possibly find the end node also. If get this part done fast will also add the path drawing functionality and connect it into the GUI.
