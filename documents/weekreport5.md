## Week report 5

### JPS almost done

This week I unfortunately have not had much time to work on the algorithm. But the algorithm basic structure should be done now. This means the algorithm should be able to identify when it reaches the end point or if there is no path. What is still lacking is the distance calculations and path creation. Distance logic is something that is still quite open how this will be solved, but pathfinding will use a predecessor array just like dijkstra, and with it also pathdrawin possibility is the same way.

### Lack of tests and javadoc

As there have not been quite enough time to get the algorithm as far as I wanted, I have not had time to either create the documentation and tests for the program yet. Have decided to focus now on getting the algorithm working and after that will use time to refactor a few things and create all the tests and documentations. Not an ideal approach but I have to use the time I have on the main learning point for me, the algorithms.

### Next week

Next week should have the algorithm working fully, the goal is to have the program working as intended by the end of next week. This gives me plenty of time to refactor some code, generate documentation and add unit tests for the program.
